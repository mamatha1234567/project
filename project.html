    <h2>PROJECT TITLE:</h2><h3>ESTIMATION OF DROUGHT PREDICTION USING DEEP LEARNING MODELS</h3>
    <h2>ROLE:</h2><h3>TEAM LEAD</h3></bold></h3>
    <h2>TECHNOLOGY:</h2><h3>DEEP LEARNING</h3>
    <h2>DESCRIPTION:</h2>
    <pre>  we predict the drought by using deep learning models like cnn,vgg16.This will helpful to agriculture.
    Agricultural is the primary source of income for the majority of the population. In recent decades, 
    it has been discovered that soil fertility is linked to sustainable agriculture, and that preserving 
    soil fertility can increase present crop output levels. Hence the DL models like CNN and VGG16 transfer
    models are implemented and compared for their performances.CNN model has been applied for classification 
    of real time image data obtained from satellite resources.
